Research Experiences
======
* Financial Advisors’ Awareness of Climate Risks: A Textual Analysis Perspective
  * Co-authors: Prof. Darwin Choi, Prof. Zhenyu Gao and Prof. Wenxi Jiang
  * Keywords: Climate Finance; Investor Behaviour; Textual Analysis
  * Preprocess hundreds of gigabytes of PDF documents into TXT format.
  * Design a machine learning pipeline for iterative labelling to construct a high-quality training dataset.
  * Fine-tune BERT to classify unlabelled corpus and achieve 85+% test accuracy.
  * Construct a climate-awareness measure to quantify firms’ realization of climate risks.
  * Conduct robust regressions to analyze how climate-awareness affects fund portfolio holdings and return performance.

* A Theoretical Analysis of UCT with Laplace Bound
  * Co-authors: Prof. Joelle Pineau and Dr. Audrey Durand
  * Keywords: Machine Learning; Statistical Learning Theory; Optimization
  * First proved UCT algorithm using the Laplace bound that has a lower regret bound than its counterparts.
  * Showed experimental results are consistent with the theoretical regret bound in deep learning settings.

* Bandit Algorithms for Factorial Experiments
  * Co-authors: Prof. Joelle Pineau and Dr. Audrey Durand
  * Keywords: Machine Learning; Optimization
  * Implemented a family of bandit algorithms.
  * Investigated various factorial experimental design configurations.
  * Concluded that UCT algorithms for factorial experimental designs are robust.
