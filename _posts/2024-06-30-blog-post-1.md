## Improving Stata Newey-West Command Output

Stata's built-in `newey` command does not output \( R^2 \) and adjusted \( R^2 \) by default. Notably, the \( R^2 \) from `newey` is the same as that from OLS. To facilitate exporting these statistics, particularly for use with `reg2docx`, I've created a custom command.

First, remove any existing program by the same name:

```stata
cap program drop newey_r2
```

Define the new command that will calculate and display \( R^2 \) and adjusted \( R^2 \):

```stata
program define newey_r2, eclass
    syntax varlist [if] [in], [lag(string) otheropt(string)]
    
    marksample touse
    
    qui count if touse
    local N = r(N)
    
    if "`lag'" == "" {
        local lag = round(4 * (`N' / 100)^(2 / 9), 1)
    }
    
    qui reg `varlist' if `touse'
    local r2 = e(r2)
    local r2_a = e(r2_a)
    
    dis as text "Newey-West regression using newey_r2"
    dis as text _column(49) "R-squared" _c
    dis as text _column(67) "=" _c
    dis as result %11.4f `r2'
    dis as text _column(49) "Adj R-squared" _c
    dis as text _column(67) "=" _c
    dis as result %11.4f `r2_a' _c
    newey `varlist' if `touse' , lag(`lag') otheropt'
    
    ereturn scalar r2 = `r2'
    ereturn scalar r2_a = `r2_a'
end
```

To implement this custom command, follow these steps based on your operating system:

- On Ubuntu: Go to `/home/USERNAME/STATA_DIR/ado/base/n` (replace USERNAME with your username and STATA_DIR with your Stata directory)
- On Mac: Go to `/Applications/Stata/ado/base/n`

Use vim to open or create `newey_r2.ado`, and paste the above code into this file.

### Testing the Command

To ensure the command works correctly, test it with some sample data:

```stata
webuse idle2 , clear
tset time

eststo: newey usr idle , lag(3)
est store m1

eststo: newey_r2 usr idle , lag(3)
est store m2

eststo: newey_r2 usr idle // lag is automatically calculated
est store m3

esttab using ./test.csv, b(3) t(2) ar2(3) star(* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) nogaps nonotes replace
```

This script demonstrates the enhanced functionality of `newey_r2`, including the automatic calculation of optimal lags and exporting of \( R^2 \) and adjusted \( R^2 \) statistics, which are crucial for robust regression analysis and documentation.
